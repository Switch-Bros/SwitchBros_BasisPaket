Wait for FastFS 4 emuMMC).\\nThis version can sanely shutdown and also supports more SD cards than before.\\nThanks to a collab with @m4xw , @SciresM, @hexkyz.\\nSupercharged boot times\\nEven with emuMMC or kip1 patching, it's faster than before.\\nSupercharged Backup/Restore with FastFS (Nyx only)\\nBackup and Restore is now orders of magnitudes faster.\\nSome examples (measured on a U3 SD): No verif: 9min, Sparse: 15min, etc. Even Full with hashes is extremely faster.\\nExternal KIP1 patching support\\nNow non-important patches reside outside of hekate binary. For now this can only patch KIPs defined in hekate's code, with whatever new patches. Next versions will support other KIPs.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\nNyx v0.8.0\\n\\nSnappy and fluid GUI w/ touch support\\nYes! This runs on BPMP!\\nAll classic launch options are there\\nemuMMC manage\\nChange between raw partition emuMMCs and SD file based ones easily.\\nCreate file based or raw partition based from eMMC via the Create button.\\nYou can also restore a backup directly to sd partition via the Restore option in tools (outside of emuMMC), AFTER you turned ON SD emuMMC Raw Partition.\\nMigrate other types of emunand (raw partition or sd file), repair existing raw partition configurations, or migrate a backup (outside of restore folder), to sd file based.\\nEverything is currently made to protect Linux partitions.\\nAdditionally, the raw partition based is done in 16MB offset, so it can protected from quick formats.\\nAll Info and Tools are now supercharged\\nDump individual kips from eMMC, see detailed info about fuses, do backups and restores way faster, etc.\\nCustomization support\\nCustom icons for boot entries and also a background is supported.

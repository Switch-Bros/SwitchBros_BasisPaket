  "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed.\\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.",
  "changelog": "1.7.3\\n\\n(stability update)\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nLong tap (touch > 0.5s) of an overlay / package on the main menu will now open the overlay / package settings menu upon release.\\nFuse data is now reloaded / re-dumped upon boot.\\nNew true / false option disable_reload is now stored in fuse.ini for manual disabling of the fuse data reload function.\\nMore corrections and improvements to the wallpaper swapping feature.\\nInterpreter relevant bug fixes (especially with handing large boot_package.ini files).\\nThese fixes should make opening OC Toolkit faster as well as fix the Backup and Restore functions when used with wallpapers.\\nFew additional minor bug fixes.\\nImportant: Fuse data has new key names, so you may need to reboot once or delete sdmc:/config/ultrahand/fuse.ini after updating from v1.7.2.\\n\\nFull Changelog: 9ff96ba...v1.7.3\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nSlight table text alignment correction. - 09/05/2024 6:10 AM PST\\nFull Changelog: v1.7.3...9f6c2d8\\n\\n1.7.2\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nContinued expansion of Device Info to now include local IP, eMMC storage, CPU/GPU/SOC Speedo + IDDQ and more.\\nFuse related data is auto-dumped to sdmc:/config/ultrahand/fuse.ini if fuse.ini is missing.\\nSpecial thanks to Masagrator.\\nSlight reorganization of Settings Menu.\\nMore renderer related tweaks and bug fixes. (faster pixel rendering / more FPS)\\nPackage settings menu now includes a toggle for Boot Package and Error Logging.\\nError logging will now only occur for packages when Error Logging is set to an On state. (off by default)\\nLogs will be generated within the package folder in log.txt.\\nRoot package / root boot package logging will only work with command logging.\\nCalls of logging command will always bypass Error Logging and log errors and commands to the designated log.txt.\\nNew placeholder variables {cpu_speedo}, {cpu_iddq}, {gpu_speedo}, {gpu_iddq}, {soc_speedo} and {soc_iddq}.\\nNew progress indicator bar for visualizing download, unzip, and copy percentages.\\nNew theme color settings progress_color and progress_alpha.\\nReturn of shutdown controllers for manually powering off all connected bluetooth controllers.\\nThis feature still does not work with Mission Control. Just a heads up.\\nNew language variables.\\nAlternate languages may still need translations done to the updated .json files.\\nUpdates to libraries devkitA64 and libnx.\\nNumerous code optimizations for smaller compilation size and slightly faster commands.\\nVarious bug fixes.\\nFull Changelog: d959363...v1.7.2\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nPre-release period is over. Things appear to be stable. - (09/03/2024 12:27 PM PST)\\nNumber of memory related bug fixes.\\nCorrections to memory ID (got messed up upon initial release).\\nCouple logging related bug fixes.\\nCopy buffer has been increased to 4x and properly linked.\\nLive wallpaper swapping bug fix. - (09/03/2024 3:21 AM PST)\\nMore live wallpaper swapping bug fixes. - (09/03/2024 4:15 AM PST)\\nTighter/stricter timing for swapping wallpapers to prevent more random crashes. - (09/03/2024 6:28 AM PST)\\n\\n1.7.1\\n\\nExpanded System page to include various device related information.\\nThis table currently includes device firmware, bootloader version, hardware type, memory information, and storage information.\\nSpecial thanks to ComplexNarrative.\\nNew command placeholder variables {ram_vendor}, {ram_model}, {ams_version}, and {hos_version}.\\nExpansion of refresh command to include wallpaper for the ability to reload wallpaper.rgba,\\nCalled refresh wallpaper.\\nImproved scrolling implementation. (proper time-synced speed interpolation)\\nComplete recalibration of character width map.\\nThis should result in more proper table alignments when using tables with info sections aligned to the right.\\nMultiple memory related bug fixes.\\nMore memory leaks have been fixed, which should result in less heap overloads / crashes.\\nLanguage replacements are now performed on every ListItem and CategoryHeader upon initialization.\\nThis fixed entries like, for example, Reboot To and Shutdown from not being properly translated.\\nLanguage json's may still need some translations for the new words that have been included.\\nRemoval of shutdown controllers for space conservation. (commented out)\\nDid not want to remove this function, but because it only works with Nintendo controllers (and not Mission Control) it does seem somewhat redundant since the sync button on Nintendo controllers effectively turns off the controller as well.\\nIf it is highly desirable, I may include this command again in future revisions. But for size stability, I could not get it to fit properly this time around.\\nNumerous code optimizations and bug fixes.\\n\\n1.7.0\\n\\nNew memory expansion option (located in Settings > System).\\nThis function requires internet the first time it is ran, otherwise you can place nx-ovlloader.zip and nx-ovlloader+.zip in sdmc:/config/ultrahand/expansion/. (see here for the .zips)\\nnx-ovlloader.zip (base memory) and nx-ovlloader+.zip (expanded memory) are recompilations of WerWolv's nx-ovlloader 1.0.6/1.0.7.\\nNotice: This feature will utilize an extra 2 MB of system memory for overlays and will require a reboot after being toggled for changes to apply.\\nNew wallpapers implementation. (requires memory expansion)\\nWallpapers must be formatted in .rgba and be exactly 448x720 pixels in resolution.\\nPlace .rgba formatted wallpapers into sdmc:/config/ultrahand/wallpapers/, then they will show up in the Wallpaper Manager in the Settings Menu.\\nSidenote: For full 60 FPS in Ultrahand with wallpapers, overclock CPU >=1581.0 MHz.\\nNumerous optimizations to the libTesla renderer.\\nMulti-thread rendering. (requires expanded memory)\\nReduced big-O complexity.\\nSidenote: With stock clocks and no wallpaper, users should expect to now get ~60 FPS in menu. 😎\\nVarious improvements to tables, track-bars and the track-bar highlight/select cursor.\\nTime-synced controller scrolling implementation, time-synced click saturation effect, and a variety of corrections within libTesla.\\nMod .pchtxt's now utilize @stop properly when generating IPS mods. (helpful for developers)\\nNew Polish language implementation and slight bug fixes to the languages menu.\\nVarious bug fixes.\\nFix for missing pre-generated root package.

Direct modification of the overlay is still required for any re-naming of the overlay modules themselves.\\nPackages will now assume names in the following priorities.\\ni. Priority 0: Custom names and versions written in packages.ini.\\nii. Priority 1: Package name stated in the header in the package.ini file for the Ultrahand package.\\niii. Priority 2: If none of the above, it will assume the name based upon the Ultrahand package folder.\\nIf left empty, custom name and version parameters will be unused.\\nNew option for table ;header_indent= for drawing a single header indent on left side of the line.\\nThis is meant to be used on one line \"header-like\" tables.\\nNew table text color options for info_text_color and section_text_color.\\ntext : Ultrahand theme text color used for default text.\\nheader : Ultrahand theme text color used for headers.\\non_value : Ultrahand theme color for On values / values.\\noff_value : Ultrahand theme color for Off values / version labels.\\nKey combo string representations in packages will now return their symbolic representation.\\nSoftware update menu will now pull an indicator for the latest Ultrahand Overlay version from the GitHub API.\\nThemes classic.ini and ultra.ini will now be auto-downloaded when opening the Theme manager if they do not exist.\\nDownloads are now stored in a temporary state until completion.

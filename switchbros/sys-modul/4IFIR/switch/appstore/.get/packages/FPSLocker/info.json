  "description": "An overlay that allows to set custom FPS in retail games.",
  "details": "An overlay that with companion SaltyNX plugin NX-FPS allows to set custom FPS in Nintendo Switch retail games.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Tool is utilizing detection of graphics API to manipulate FPS and in special cases it requires using patches made per game for each version to get more than 30 FPS. You can find those patches HERE\\nMax supported yaml size is 32kB, though it can be expanded in next updates.\\n\\nRequirements:\\n* Atmosphere CFW\\n* My fork of SaltyNX, version 0.5.1+\\n* NX-FPS 1.1+\\n* Tesla environment: ovlloader + Tesla Menu\\n\\nOverlay runs in two modes:\\n\\n* When game is running\\n\\nIf game is supported by SaltyNX and you installed everything correctly, you will see menu where first line states NX-FPS plugin is running. Explanation of each line:\\n\\nInterval Mode - it's used by NVN API to set limiter to either 30 FPS (2) or 60 FPS (1 or 0 (0 means that game never bothered to set it, it can be also a sign that game is not utilizing NVN but EGL or Vulkan))\\nCustom FPS Target - it's used to lock game to certain FPS. If game is using engine proprietary FPS locks, it may not be able to unlock more than 30 FPS without additional patches.\\nBig number on the right - it shows how many frames have passed in last second for currently running game. This is to confirm that lock is working as expected.\\nIncrease/Decrease FPS target - Change FPS Target by 5. Minimum is 15 FPS, max is 60 FPS. If FPS is set above 30 FPS, it sets interval mode to 1. Otherwise it sets interval to 2.\\nDisable custom FPS target - Removes FPS Target. Since we cannot predict what interval mode is expected at this point, it is in user's discretion to manipulate FPS to bring back correct interval before disabling FPS target.\\nAdvanced settings - submenu which consists of:\\nSync Wait - this is dangerous setting that disabled in most cases will crash game (for example Witcher 3 and Breath of The Wild), but in some can bring benefit of disabling double buffer at the cost of small graphical glitches (for example Xenoblade Chronicles 3). Use it with caution.\\nConvert config to patch file - if proper config file exists for this game and version, you will get an option to convert it to patch file that will be loaded when you will run this game next time. Patch is saved to SaltySD/plugins/FPSLocker/patches/*titleid_uppercase*/*buildid_uppercase*.bin\\nDelete patch file - if proper config file exists for this game and version, you will get an option to delete patch file so it won't be loaded when you will run this game next time.\\nSave settings - save profile for currently running game that will be loaded next time by plugin on boot automatically. Don't use it if you disabled Sync Wait and you didn't test it properly that it won't cause crash. Profile is saved in SaltySD/plugins/FPSLocker/*titleid_uppercase*.dat\\n\\n* When game is not running:\\n\\nIt will list installed games (max 32) and as first option it's available \"All\" submenu.\\nInside each one you will find two options:\\n\\nDelete settings - it will delete file created by \"Save settings\" option\\nDelete patches - it will delete file created by \"Convert config to patch file\" option\\n\\nThanks to ~WerWolv for creating Tesla environment, and ~cucholix + ~Monked for tests.",
  "changelog": "2.0.0\\n\\nAdd Display settings menu to change LCD refresh rate (don't put Switch to dock with changed refresh rate while game is running, otherwise there is a chance game will crash), not available for OLED model. SaltyNX 0.8.0+ is required for this menu to show.

  "details": "Background process for the Nintendo Switch for file/code modification\\n\\nCreated by: https://github.com/shinyquagsire23\\n\\nThis fork includes many QoL improvements\\n\\n\\nFor additional functions you need SaltyNX-Tool.\\n\\n",
  "changelog": "1.0.0\\n\\nAdd support for 32-bit games (this includes NX-FPS and ReverseNX, it excludes external plugins)\\nFix issue with asm patches memory overflowing\\nFix bug in FPS lock not working properly in EGL and Vulkan games\\nThanks to all people who helped me testing this on as many 32-bit games as possible.\\n\\n0.9.3\\n\\nDisable ReverseNX-RT in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, fixing game crashing when exiting.\\n\\n0.9.2\\n\\nFix resolution grabbing compability with Skyrim by changing accepted ratios from <1.3, 1.9) to <1.2, 1.9)\\n\\n0.9.1\\n\\nExtended grabbed resolutions accepted ratios from <1.7, 1.9) to <1.3, 1.9). Fixes dynamic resolution detection issue with games using Id Tech engine like DOOM 2016, Doom Eternal, Wolfenstein 2.\\n\\n0.9.0\\n\\nAdd support for new iteration of Vulkan (fixes issues with Star Wars Bounty Hunter detection)\\nAdd support for dumping resolutions from games using NVN\\nREMEMBER TO REMOVE NX-FPS.elf and ReverseNX-RT.elf FROM SaltySD/plugins FOLDER, otherwise there will be dragons!\\n\\n0.8.1\\n\\nUpdated display refresh rate change function which now sets it perfectly instead of \"very close\" (thanks to Cooler3D for sharing how to fix it).\\nFix improperly implemented gatekeeping OLED model from using Display Sync via IPC\\nREMEMBER TO REMOVE NX-FPS.elf and ReverseNX-RT.elf FROM SaltySD/plugins FOLDER, otherwise there will be dragons!\\n\\n0.7.4\\n\\nReapply custom NVN interval in case if game avoids using NVN API to set it (fixes an issue with Call of Juarez: Gunslinger reapplying 30 FPS lock)\\n\\n0.7.3\\n\\nFix shared memory not being cleaned up upon going into hbmenu in title override (this caused ReverseNX-RT overlay to show that ReverseNX was active while it was not)\\n\\n0.7.2\\n\\nFix compability issues with updated rtld's ModuleObject struct (fixes crash in Tomb Raider I-III Remastered)\\nAdd Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze to exceptions (heap issues from second level)\\n\\n0.7.1\\n\\nApply hacky solution for not working replace imports in retail games using RELR.\\nReduce size of Core by half\\n\\n0.7.0\\n\\nSupport replacing imports in NROs (f.e. EA SPORTS FC 24)\\nIntegrate NX-FPS and ReverseNX-RT plugins into Core source code, allows importing them to 64-bit games that have issues with plugins. In case of using plugins that replace imports for the same functions as those two are using, plugins have priority except for nn::ro::LoadModule.\\n\\n0.6.1\\n\\nFix compability issues with Atmosphere 1.5.5 by adding 128kB to fake heap\\n\\n0.6.0\\n\\nReduce size of sysmodule executable by 2/3 and memory footprint of sysmodule by ~45%\\nAdd new flag for exceptions.txt - R.\\nR flag will abort loading SaltyNX to game if game has romfs mod installed. This is to prevent collisions in case of Atmosphere taking memory from game when game has big number of romfs files and could prevent game with injected SaltyNX from booting because of memory exhaustion. For now such a game doesn't exist, but Zelda Tears of The Kingdom is pretty close. This is futureproofing for possibility.\\n\\n0.5.2\\n\\nFix RTLD detection for getBID() in older games like LA Noire\\n\\n0.5.1\\n\\nAdd function SaltySD_GetBID() to use with plugins to retrieve buildID of running game\\nFix bug that was causing SharedMemory to not clean up upon detection of game that is 32-bit or in exceptions.txt (fixes bug in homebrew reading SharedMemory, f.e. Status Monitor Overlay, FPSLocker and ReverseNX-RT). Thanks to ~cucholix for finding this bug and testing fix.\\n\\n0.5.0\\n\\nAdd SharedMemory 4096B block to use with plugins.\\n\\nSaltyNX is reserving 4096 byte block to use with any app. Default purpose is to allow exchanging data in real time between homebrew and plugins without using dmnt:cht/svcDebug\\n\\n0.4.0a-hotfix\\n\\nFixed sm compability issues with Atmosphere 0.19.0+\\n\\n0.4.0a\\n\\nResolves issue with nonconsistent heap reserving.\\nFIFA 18-21 and Darksiders 2 are now working properly.\\n\\nEDIT: It doesn't work correctly with M.16.2 (0.16.2 EXPERIMENTAL). Works on standard 0.16.2\\n\\n0.3.2a\\n\\nFix loading plugins from titleid folders ef8ff67\\nIt should now fix bug introduced from 0.3.0a with crashing plugins in Smash Bros and other games while using title specific plugins\\n\\ninclude another exception - abort loading plugins if:\\ntitleid & 0x1F00 != 0\\n\\n0.3.1a\\n\\nFixed rare case of crashing game when trying to load hbloader in title replacement mode by disabling bootstrap in this case\\n2MB fix reverted, as this was crashing Zelda BoTW\\n\\n0.3.0\\n\\nAdd support for patches (more in readme)\\n** Thanks to this it's possible to omit crashes with code injection if it doesn't need heap to work.\\n\\n0.2.1a\\n\\nReduced RAM usage by 320kB.\\n\\n0.2.0a\\n\\nDitched Spawner\\nRewrited Proc to be independent and now it's booted directly from CFW as sysmodule\\n** Thanks to this I could lower memory usage by 60 kB\\nAdded option to disable log writing (writing is enabled by default)\\nAdded toolbox.json to bring correct support for sysmodules managers\\nBecause of ditching Spawner, KIP is not possible to use anymore. That's why we have now only one package using exefs.\\n\\nsaltysd_proc.elf from SaltySD folder is not used anymore, you can delete it.\\n\\nNSP-0.2\\n\\nUpdate solving compability issues with FW 10.0.0 for people using NSP.zip\\nIssue is not existing for KIP, so you don't need to update anything if you are using it (appstore is using NSP.zip)\\n\\n0.1.2a\\n\\nImplement hack to resolve issues with cheats in Atmosphere."
